<p>The Dess-Martin oxidation is a method used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones using the Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP).<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

## Finding the Product for a 1° Alcohol

This section is a brief overview on how to find the product for a 1° Alcohol (Primary) using a example from a real scientific research paper.

    Condensed Synthesis Overview of (+)-Cortistatin A from Hajos-Parrish Ketone.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
  The overall synthesis of (+)-Cortistatin A started with an enantiomerically pure Hajos-Parrish ketone undergoing key reactions such as diastereoselective hydrogenation, Rubottom oxidation, the Dess-Martin oxidation and other types of reactions to eventually form the target compound (+)-Cortistatin A. This occurs over a 26 step synthesis pathway.

- 1° Alcohols (Primary) get oxidized to **Aldehydes**.
- 2° Alcohols (Secondary) get oxidized to **Ketones**.
- 3° Alcohols (Tertiary) **do not** get oxidized at all.

### General Mechanism

This section briefly summarizes steps to find the product and perform the mechanisms.


**Quick steps to finding the product for any alcohol**
1. Identify the reagents.
2. Assign side chains (non alcohol part).
3. Selectively convert Alcohol to correct product based on alcohol type. Nothing else.
4. Keep the side chains (non alcohol part) the same and piece together the full molecule together again.

<Tip>Always remember to repeatedly practice your mechanisms and getting your reagents correct. Take advantage of our materials and/or keep practicing on a whiteboard or paper until you get it right every single time.</Tip>
