The Dess-Martin oxidation, developed by Dr. J.C Martin and his doctoral student Daniel Benjamin Dess, is a method used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones using the Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP), a hypervalent iodine compound. This reagent is known for its mild conditions, high selectivity, and efficiency, making it a valuable tool in organic synthesis.

In the original paper "Readily Accessible 12-I-51 Oxidant for the Conversion of Primary and Secondary Alcohols to Aldehydes and Ketones." by Dess & Martin (1983), they discovered a novel and efficient reagent, periodinane 2 (DMP), used to convert primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones.

This was performed without the usage of water which was reported to accelerate the rate of oxidation. However, the mechanism is slightly modified in comparison the oxidation with water.

When water is introduced, the rate of oxidation increases which accelerates the reaction. However, in comparison to the oxidation with water, the mechanism is slightly different.

## Dess-Martin Periodinane

Periodinane 2, also known as Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), was originally derived from 2-iodobenzoic acid and exhibited remarkable efficiency and selectivity. It was reported that DMP was soluble in other solvents such as in hexane or ether were deemed sparingly soluble. Additionally, it was deemed very soluble in dichloromethane, chloroform and acetonitrile. Dichloromethane (DCM) was reported as the primary solvent used as stated by Dess & Martin (1983).

#### Acetoxy Group vs Acetate Ion

Understanding the distinction between the acetate ion and the acetoxy group is crucial in grasping the chemical behavior and reactivity of molecules like DMP. While the acetoxy group is part of the structure of DMP, it becomes an acetate ion upon leaving the molecule during the oxidation reaction, playing the as role as a good leaving group to become a stable, negatively charged ion.

</div>

|   | **Acetoxy Group (OAc)**   | **Acetate Ion (CH₃COO⁻)**  |
|---|---|---|
|  **Definition** | The OAc group (acetoxy) is a familiar functional group consisting of an acetyl group (CH₃CO) bonded to an oxygen atom. | The acetate ion is a charged particle with a negative electrical charge, formed when an acetoxy group is expelled and loses a hydrogen atom. |
| **Role in DMP**  | In DMP, three acetoxy groups are bonded to the central iodine atom, making them part of the larger molecule. | Has no role in DMP itself. |
|  **Formation & Notation** | R-OAc, where R represents the rest of the DMP molecule. | In reactions, when the OAc group is expelled from DMP, it becomes an acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), carrying a negative charge as it takes an extra electron pair. |

The preparation of Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP) involves **two key steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Treatment">
    irst, 2-iodobenzoic acid is treated with potassium bromate (KBrO<sub>3</sub>) in sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), maintaining the temperature below 55°C during the addition of KBrO<sub>3</sub>. The mixture is then warmed to 65°C and stirred for 3.6 hours, producing the cyclic tautomer of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid with a 93% yield.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Product Formation">
    Next, a stirred slurry of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid in acetic anhydride and acetic acid is heated to 100°C until the solid dissolves. The solvent is then removed under vacuum at room temperature, resulting in a thick slurry, which is filtered in an inert atmosphere and washed with ether, yielding Periodinane 2 with an 87% overall yield from the iodobenzoic acid.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reagent Facts

DMP is easy to prepare, remains stable under proper storage conditions and is environmentally friendly, producing benign by-products compared to toxic chromium-based oxidizers which often required time-consuming filitration procedures.

James Cullen Martin (1928-1999), a prominent figure in organic chemistry community known for his work on hypervalent compounds, passed away on April 20, 1999. Martin's most notable contribution is the invention of the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP) in 1983, developed with his doctoral student Daniel Benjamin Dess.

This reagent revolutionized the oxidation of alcohols, offering a straightforward synthesis and mild reaction conditions. DMP efficiently oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones, avoiding toxic by-products and simplifying the process. Its selective and environmentally friendly properties have made it a staple in laboratories worldwide.

Rest in Peace,<br/>
**Dr. J.C. Martin**
