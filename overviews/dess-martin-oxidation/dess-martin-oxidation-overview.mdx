The Dess-Martin oxidation, developed by Dr. J.C Martin and his doctoral student Daniel Benjamin Dess, is a method used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones using the Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP), a hypervalent iodine compound. This reagent is known for its mild conditions, high selectivity, and efficiency, making it a valuable tool in organic synthesis. <sup>**1**</sup>

In the original paper "Readily Accessible 12-I-51 Oxidant for the Conversion of Primary and Secondary Alcohols to Aldehydes and Ketones." by Dess & Martin (1983), they discovered a novel and efficient reagent, periodinane 2 (DMP), used to convert primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. <sup>**1**</sup>

This was performed without the usage of water which was reported to accelerate the rate of oxidation. However, the mechanism is slightly modified in comparison the oxidation with water. <sup>**1**</sup> <sup>**2**</sup>

## Dess-Martin Periodinane

Periodinane 2, also known as Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), was originally derived from 2-iodobenzoic acid and exhibited remarkable efficiency and selectivity. It was reported that DMP was soluble in other solvents such as in hexane or ether were deemed sparingly soluble. Additionally, it was deemed very soluble in dichloromethane, chloroform and acetonitrile. Dichloromethane (DCM) was reported as the primary solvent used as stated by Dess & Martin (1983).

#### Acetoxy Group vs Acetate Ion

Understanding the distinction between the acetate ion and the acetoxy group is crucial in grasping the chemical behavior and reactivity of molecules like DMP. While the acetoxy group is part of the structure of DMP, it becomes an acetate ion upon leaving the molecule during the oxidation reaction, playing the as role as a good leaving group to become a stable, negatively charged ion.

 Here are the essential distinctions to understand.
  </p>
</div>

|   | **Acetoxy Group (OAc)**   | **Acetate Ion (CH₃COO⁻)**  |
|---|---|---|
|  **Definition** | The OAc group (acetoxy) is a familiar functional group consisting of an acetyl group (CH₃CO) bonded to an oxygen atom. | The acetate ion is a charged particle with a negative electrical charge, formed when an acetoxy group is expelled and loses a hydrogen atom. |
| **Role in DMP**  | In DMP, three acetoxy groups are bonded to the central iodine atom, making them part of the larger molecule. | Has no role in DMP itself. |
|  **Formation & Notation** | R-OAc, where R represents the rest of the DMP molecule. | In reactions, when the OAc group is expelled from DMP, it becomes an acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), carrying a negative charge as it takes an extra electron pair. |

The preparation of Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP) involves **two key steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Treatment">
    2-iodobenzoic acid is treated with potassium bromate (KBrO<sub>3</sub>) in sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), maintaining the temperature below 55°C during the addition of KBrO<sub>3</sub>. 
    
    The mixture is then warmed to 65°C and stirred for 3.6 hours, producing the cyclic tautomer of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid with a 93% yield.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Product Formation">
    Stirred slurry of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid in acetic anhydride and acetic acid is heated to 100°C until the solid dissolves. 
    
    The solvent is then removed under vacuum at room temperature, resulting in a thick slurry, which is filtered in an inert atmosphere and washed with ether, yielding Periodinane 2 with an 87% overall yield from the iodobenzoic acid.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reagent Facts

DMP is easy to prepare, remains stable under proper storage conditions and is environmentally friendly, producing benign by-products compared to toxic chromium-based oxidizers which often required time-consuming filitration procedures. <sup>**1**</sup> <sup>**2**</sup> <sup>**3**</sup>

James Cullen Martin (1928-1999) was a leading chemist known for his influential work on hypervalent compounds. Born in Dover, Tennessee, Martin completed his education at Vanderbilt University and Harvard University, studying under Paul Bartlett. <sup>**4**</sup> His career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign saw him advance from instructor to division head in organic chemistry. <sup>**4**</sup>

Martin’s most notable contribution was the development of the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP) in 1983, created with his student Daniel Benjamin Dess. DMP provided a mild, selective method for alcohol oxidation that avoided toxic by-products, making it widely used in laboratories globally. Martin also introduced Martin’s sulfurane, further advancing organic synthesis. <sup>**1**</sup> <sup>**5**</sup>

His research, honored with a Guggenheim Fellowship and an Alexander von Humboldt Prize, included 155 publications in major journals, covering topics such as hypervalent iodine, phosphorus, and sulfurane chemistry. His legacy endures through his innovative contributions and dedication to mentoring the next generation of chemists. <sup>**5**</sup>

Martin's personal life was as rich as his professional one. He was born on January 14, 1928, in Dover, Tennessee, and served in the US Army from 1946 to 1950. During his service, he spent time in Kyoto, Japan, as a cultural liaison after World War II. <sup>**5**</sup>

Known for his gentle and generous character, Martin balanced his demanding career with a strong commitment to his family. He married June E. Martin, an occupational therapist, and together they had five children. <sup>**5**</sup>

This Waka was prepared and written by the author for the ISOCS-21 Conference in Madrid in July 2004, in memory of Professor James C. Martin. A Waka is a traditional Japanese short poem consisting of 31 phonetic characters. This is based on a well-known Waka in the Man'yōshū, the oldest collection of Waka, which is supported by the Emperor. The Japanese reading is shown in the Romanized form, followed by a translation. <sup>**5**</sup>
